This experiment produces 2 output files - here you can find some additional information about them.




'Produced_Data.csv' is a CSV file produced after running source code 
(it will be saved in the same file as source code). This file has 4 columns
and  13 (12+1) rows. The first column represents Dates (year 2016) corresponding 
to the total monthly bicycle ride on Vienna bicycle routes, which is the second column. 
The third column represents Dates corresponding to the monthly number of measles infections
per million for the EU/EEA region (year 2017/2018), which is the fourth column. 
The first row contains the names of the columns. 





The exported graphics can be saved as PNG file. This graph shows the points saved in the CSV file above.
The x-axes represent 12 months (not the particular 12 months, they are different for both data points).
There are two y-axes, one per dataset. They are correspondingly marked- the left one represents 
total monthly rides in Vienna bicycle routes and the right one represents the monthly number of 
measles infections per million in the EU/EEA region.
