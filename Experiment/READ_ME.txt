This folder contains source code for the experiment that makes a correlation between two datasets
as well as both datasets and their metadata. 




In order to run this experiment, you have to install RStudio, Version  1.1.463. 
Please follow the instruction on https://www.rstudio.com/  



Accept the default packages, you additionally need to install the package 'ggplot2'.






Both input datasets are contained in file /data. You want to include only 2 csv files- 
you can find a CSV file for the first dataset in /data/raw/rad_vz_2016.csv.  
Another csv file for the second dataset is in /data/measles.table12018-10-31.csv.  
You should insert two file paths in the code to the place provided (see code comments).





After inserting the file paths, you should just run the code - the output CSV file 
will be written in the source file directory. The graphics will be produced, 
but you have to export it - just click export on the top of the graphics, 
you can choose different formats (among them PNG format).
